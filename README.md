# AFL_model_2017

This repository contains a predictive model for AFL match results.

Using 2012-2016 data on match results and match stats, a model is trained to predict the winner of a match.
The model is evaluated against given betting odds for home vs. away team winning and simulated betting is conducted on 2017 data to evaluate betting performance.
